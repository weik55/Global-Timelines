This was a project developed for a HCDE class I took as part of my coursework. It pulls information from Wikipedia's history pages by Wikipedia's API and using the old framework of Google App Engine, the app displays the information as a timeline to compare various histories of the world.

Due to Google App Engine changes, this project currently needs to be migrated and updated. I leave this here to show a sample of my code, and the idea behind this project. I may revisit this at a later time.

Thanks.
